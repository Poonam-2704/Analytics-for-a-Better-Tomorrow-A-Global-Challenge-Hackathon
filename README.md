#Blockchain-Based Pharmaceutical Supply Chain

Overview

The Blockchain-Based Pharmaceutical Supply Chain project leverages blockchain technology to ensure the authenticity and traceability of pharmaceutical products. By creating a secure and transparent system, this project aims to prevent counterfeit drugs from entering the supply chain and enhance trust among manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, and consumers.

Key Features

Drug Registration on Blockchain â€“ Each drug batch receives a unique identifier stored securely on the blockchain.  
Ownership Tracking â€“ Ensures a transparent transfer of drugs from manufacturers to distributors and pharmacies.  
Data Integrity â€“ Blockchain records cannot be altered, preventing fraud and counterfeiting.   
User Verification â€“ Consumers can verify drug authenticity by checking its history on the blockchain.

Technology Stack

Blockchain: Ethereum, Ganache.  
Smart Contracts: Solidity, Truffle, Remix IDE.  
Frontend: HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Web3.js.  



Setup Instructions

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (with npm).  
Truffle (npm install -g truffle).       
Ganache (for local blockchain development).   
MetaMask (browser extension for Ethereum transactions).    

Installation Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Poonam-2704/Analytics-for-a-Better-Tomorrow-A-Global-Challenge-Hackathon.   
cd pharma-supply-chain.  

Install dependencies:

npm install.   
Start Ganache and ensure it is running on port 7545.  
Deploy the smart contract:   
truffle migrate --reset.   
Open index.html in a browser with MetaMask connected to the correct network.   

How It Works
Connect MetaMask to an Ethereum account.
Register Drugs with batch details and manufacturer information.
Transfer Ownership to track the drugâ€™s movement through the supply chain.
Verify Authenticity by checking the blockchain record for any registered drug.
